# README

This is a draft work-up of a GraphQL app built for 
a job interview coding challenge for a company named
Savvy Labs.

This is not finished or tested software. It does work, but 
should only be used for reference, not in any production environment.

* Ruby 3.2.2

* SQLLite in this version, though the JSONb requirement needs something like PostgresQL

### Use at your own risk!
